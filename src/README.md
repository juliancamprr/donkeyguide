Before we get started, let me clarify something essential: the title of this documentation, "A Guide for Donkeys," is by no means an implication that you are foolish. Quite the opposite! It's a friendly way to emphasize how easy and accessible it is to create a bot in discord.js. We believe that anyone, regardless of their prior experience, can successfully follow this guide, just as a donkey (which is notoriously stubborn and determined) can follow a straightforward path.

Now that we've cleared that up, let's embark on the journey of creating your bot in Discord.js. This guide is designed to walk you through step by step, from the beginning to the end. It doesn't matter if you're a complete beginner or an experienced programmer; we'll assist you in creating a functional bot that can be seamlessly integrated into Discord.
