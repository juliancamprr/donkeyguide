# Installation & Preparations
## Installing Node.js

Para usar o discord.js, você precisará instalar o [`Node.js`]. discord.js v14 requer Node v16.11.0 ou superior.

Discord.js relies on node.js because node.js serves as the "engine" that powers discord.js on your computer. It's as if discord.js were a car, and node.js were the engine propelling the car forward. Without node.js, discord.js cannot operate correctly because it lacks the necessary energy to make things happen on your computer. Therefore, node.js is a vital component for discord bots created with discord.js to run and interact with the discord platform.

No matter your operating system, installing Node.js is as easy as making toast! Just follow the instructions below:

On Windows, installation is as simple as pressing a button:

* **Visit the Node.js website:** First, go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) as if you were heading to a candy store.
* **Choose the version:** Select the latest version (LTS is recommended) as if you were picking your favorite ice cream flavor.
* **Download and Run the Installer:** Click the download button and open the downloaded file. The installer will guide you through the process, like a GPS to your destination.

## Downloading and setting up VSCode.

While it's not strictly essential, we recommend using `Visual Studio Code` (VSCode) for this documentation. VSCode is a highly recommended tool as it will make your experience of creating bots in discord.js easier and more efficient.

* Open your web browser.
* Visit the official Visual Studio Code website at: [`https://code.visualstudio.com/`].

**Step 2: Choose Your Version**
* On the website, you will see options to download for Windows, macOS, or Linux, depending on your operating system. Click on the button that corresponds to your platform.

**Step 3: Start the Download**
* The download will start automatically after clicking the button.

When you open VSCode, you will encounter something like this:

Not very appealing, don't you think? But don't worry, we can make it better!
